# Azure Policy to add required network CIDR ranges [without the `Count` function]
For this documentation we are going to be focusing only on the second **condition** in our `if: {}` statement. Otherwise this policy is identical to the *Modify-Network-ACL.json* one.

For an in depth break down of this policy please see: [README-Modify-Network-ACL.md](https://github.com/Joshua-Donovan/Azure-Policy-Examples/blob/2866d8c7b90df53be78d06a38d0e17530d7b07bc/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/networkAcls/.ipRules/README-Modify-Network-ACL.md)
